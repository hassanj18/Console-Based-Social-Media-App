# Console-Based Social Media App

## Overview

Welcome to the Console-Based Social Media App, a C++ application that showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through its design and functionality. This application allows users to create posts, like posts, comment on posts, manage friends, view timelines, track activities, and share memories.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create and manage user profiles.
- **Posts**: Users can create, view, and delete posts.

- **Timelines**: View a timeline of posts from friends and self.
- **Activity Tracking**: Keep track of user activities within the app.

## Object-Oriented Design

This application is structured around key OOP concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: The application uses classes to represent Users, Posts, Comments, and Activities, encapsulating data and functionality.
- **Inheritance**: Extend base classes to create specialized user types, if needed (e.g., Admin, Regular User).
- **Polymorphism**: Utilize virtual functions for dynamic behavior, such as different types of posts or user interactions.
- **Encapsulation**: Protect data through private and public access specifiers, ensuring that user data is handled securely.
